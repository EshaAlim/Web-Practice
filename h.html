                Vice Chancellor</h1>
            <p>
                The technological challenges facing agriculture in the 21st century are more daunting than ever. Land
                and water and becoming increasingly scarce. The source of growth to satisfy increased demand for food
                and agriculture products should be met through gains in productivity. The university of Agriculture
                Faisalabad has made an enormous impact through trained manpower in the field of agriculture and allied
                sciences, as well as through technologies developed. The scientists here are aware of the challenges and
                opportunities, and there, are working hard to address them. The university has recently released an
                innovation catalogue to upscale and commercialize its research outcome for the benefit of masses. That
                includes 101 ready to commercialize technologies. There are new varieties of cotton and mustard with
                potential for mechanical harvesting, three new hybrids of maize with high pro-vitamin A content, ten new
                varieties of mango, new breeds of backyard poultry, biofertilizers, mechanical and agricultural
                engineering innovations, water and energy solutions, new vaccines, value addition to agricultural
                products and many more.
